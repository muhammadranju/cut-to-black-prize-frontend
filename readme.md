## 📘 Project Overview

**Cut to Black Prize** is a web application that serves as the frontend for a prize-based activity platform.

**Key features:**

- Responsive design built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**
- Modular component architecture
- State management using React hooks
- Integration with a backend API (assumed)
- Styled with modern CSS (or CSS modules / Tailwind / etc. — adjust if different)
