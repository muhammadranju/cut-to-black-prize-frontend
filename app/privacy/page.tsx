        <br />
        <br />
        This Privacy Policy covers the information we collect about you when you
        use our products or services, or otherwise interact with us (for
        example, by attending our premises or events or by communicating with
        us), unless a different policy is displayed. We offer a wide range of
        products and services. We refer to all of these products and services,
        together with our other services and websites as "Services" in this
        policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        This policy also explains your choices surrounding how we use
        information about you, which include how you can object to certain uses
        of information about you and how you can access and update certain
        information about you. If you do not agree with this policy, do not
        access or use our Services or interact with any other aspect of our
        business.
        <br />
        <br />
        Where we provide the Services under contract with an organization, that
        organization controls the information processed by the Services. This
        policy does not apply to the extent we process personal information in
        the role of a processor on behalf of such organizations.
        <br />
        <br />
        What information we collect about you
        <br />
        <br />
        We collect information about you when you provide it to us, when you use
        our Services, and when other sources provide it to us, as further
        described below.
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        Account and Profile Information: We collect information about you when
        you register for an account, create or modify your profile, set

        <br />
        Content you provide through our products: The Services include the Call
        Sheet Media, LLC ("CSM") products you use, where we collect and store
        content that you post, send, receive and share. This content includes
        any information about you that you may choose to include.
        <br />
        <br />
        Content you provide through our websites: The Services also include our
        websites owned or operated by us. We collect other content that you
        submit to these websites, which include social media or social
        networking websites operated by us. For example, you provide content to
        us when you provide feedback or when you participate in any interactive
        features, surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, activities or
        events.
        <br />
        <br />
        Payment Information: We collect payment and billing information when you
        register for certain paid Services. You might also provide payment
        information, such as payment card details, which we collect via secure

        <br />
        Your use of the Services: We keep track of certain information about you

        includes the features you use; the links you click on; the type, size
        and filenames of attachments you upload to the Services; search terms;
        and how you interact with others on the Services. We also collect

        with them, like who you collaborate with and communicate with most
        frequently. If you use a server or data center version of the Services,
        the information we collect about your use of the Services is limited to
        clickstream data about how you interact with and use features in the
        Services, in addition to content-related information described in
        "Content you provide through our products," above.
        <br />
        <br />
        Device and Connection Information: We collect information about your
        computer, phone, tablet, or other devices you use to access the
        Services. This device information includes your connection type and
        settings when you install, access, update, or use our Services. We also
        collect information through your device about your operating system,
        browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device
        identifiers, and crash data. We use your IP address and/or country
        preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a
        better Service experience. How much of this information we collect
        depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the
        Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: CSM and our third-party
        partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies
        and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers
        and pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across
        different Services and devices.
        <br />
        <br />
        Information we receive from other sources
        <br />
        <br />
        We receive information about you from other Service users, from
        third-party services, from our related companies, social media
        platforms, public databases, and from our business and channel partners.
        We may combine this information with information we collect through
        other means described above. This helps us to update and improve our
        records, identify new customers, create more personalized advertising
        and suggest services that may be of interest to you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Other users of the Services: Other users of our Services may provide
        information about you when they submit content through the Services. We
        also receive your email address from other Service users when they
        provide it in order to invite you to the Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        Other services you link to your account: We receive information about
        you when you integrate third-party apps or link a third-party service
        with our Services. For example, if you create an account or log into the
        Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email
        address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to
        authenticate you. You may also integrate our Services with other
        services you use, such as to allow you to access, store, disclose and
        edit certain content from a third-party through our Services. For
        example, you may authorize our Services to access, display and store
        files from a third-party document-sharing service within the Services
        interface. Or you may authorize our Services to connect with a
        third-party calendaring service or to sync a contact list or address
        book so that your meetings and connections are available to you through
        the Services, so you can invite others to collaborate with you on our
        Services or so your organization can limit access to certain users. The
        information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a
        third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy
        policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check
        the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to
        understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        CSM Companies: We receive information about you from other CSM corporate
        affiliates, in accordance with their terms and policies.
        <br />
        <br />
        CSM Partners: We work with a global network of partners who provide
        consulting, implementation, training and other services around our
        products. Some of these partners also help us to market and promote our
        Services, generate leads for us, and resell our Services. We receive
        information from these partners, such as billing information, billing
        and technical contact information, company name, what CSM Services you
        have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation information you have
        provided, what events you have attended, and what country you are in.
        <br />
        <br />
        Other Partners: We receive information about you and your activities on
        and off the Services from third-party partners, such as advertising and
        market research partners who provide us with information about your
        interest in and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements.
        <br />
        <br />
        Third Party Providers: We may receive information about you from third
        party providers of business information and publicly available sources
        (like social media platforms), including physical mail addresses, job
        titles, email addresses, phone numbers, intent data (or user behavior
        data), IP addresses and social media profiles, for the purposes of
        targeted advertising of products that may interest you, delivering
        personalized communications, event promotion, and profiling.
        <br />
        <br />
        How we use information we collect
        <br />
        <br />
        How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services
        you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to
        us. Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we
        collect about you.
        <br />
        <br />
        For research and development: We are always looking for ways to make our
        Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful. We use
        information and collective learnings (including feedback) about how
        people use our Services to troubleshoot, to identify trends, usage,
        activity patterns, and areas for integration and to improve our Services
        and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our
        users and the public. We automatically analyze and aggregate search
        terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that
        auto-populate when you use the search feature. In some cases, we apply
        these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar
        features, to better integrate the Services you use, or to provide you
        with insights based on how others use our Services. We also test and
        analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature
        out to all users.
        <br />
        <br />
        To communicate with you about the Services: We use your contact
        information to send transactional communications via email and within
        the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of
        subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and
        requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices,
        updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. Depending on your
        chosen method of contact, we may send you SMS notifications or call you.
        We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and
        interactions with us. For example, certain actions you take in the
        Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app
        suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier. We also
        send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help
        you become more proficient in using that Service. These communications
        are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them.
        If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the
        communication itself or in your account settings.
        <br />
        <br />
        To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services: We use your
        contact information and information about how you use the Services to
        send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you,
        including by email and by displaying CSM ads on other companies'
        websites and applications. These communications may be informed by
        audits of interactions (like counting ad impressions), and are aimed at
        driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services,
        including information about new features, survey requests, newsletters,
        and events we think may be of interest to you. We also communicate with
        you about new Services, product offers, promotions, and contests. You
        can control whether you receive these communications as described below
        under "Opt-out of communications."
        <br />
        <br />
        Customer support: We use your information to resolve technical issues
        you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze
        crash information, and to repair and improve the Services. Where you
        give us express permission to do so, we disclose information to a third
        party expert for the purpose of responding to support-related requests.
        <br />
        <br />
        For safety and security: We use information about you and your Service
        use to verify accounts and activity, to detect, prevent, and respond to
        potential or actual security incidents and to monitor and protect
        against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity,
        including violations of Service policies.
        <br />
        <br />
        To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights: Where
        required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal
        rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about
        you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit
        functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or
        sale of a business.
        <br />
        <br />
        With your consent: We use information about you where you have given us
        consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example,
        we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the
        Services, with your permission.
        <br />
        <br />
        Legal bases for processing (for EEA users):
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect
        and process information about you only where we have legal bases for
        doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on the
        Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use
        your information only where:
        <br />
        <br />
        We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the
        Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to
        protect the safety and security of the Services; It satisfies a
        legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection
        interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote
        the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests; You give us
        consent to do so for a specific purpose; or We need to process your data
        to comply with a legal obligation. If you have consented to our use of
        information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to
        change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing
        that has already taken place. Where we are using your information
        because we or a third party have a legitimate interest to do so, you
        have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may
        mean no longer using the Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        How we disclose information we collect
        <br />
        <br />
        We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you. This
        means disclosing information through the Services and to certain third
        parties. We disclose information we collect about you in the ways
        discussed below. Please note that information about you, your devices,
        and your behavior collected through third-party cookies, pixels, tags,
        or other tracking technologies for purposes of cross-context behavioral
        advertising may be considered a “sale” or “share” under certain US state
        laws. However, CSM is not a data broker, and we do not sell personal
        information for monetary consideration.
        <br />
        <br />
        Disclosing to other Service users
        <br />
        <br />
        When you use the Services, we disclose certain information about you to
        other Service users.
        <br />
        <br />
        Community Forums: Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, forums,
        issue trackers, and wikis (e.g., CSM Community and/or CSM Developer
        Community). You should be aware that any information you provide on
        these websites - including profile information associated with the
        account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and
        used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts
        and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your
        account. We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you
        input into these Services. To request removal of your information from
        publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as
        provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your
        information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and
        why.
        <br />
        <br />
        Disclosing to third parties
        <br />
        <br />
        We disclose information to third parties that help us operate, provide,
        improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services. Data
        obtained through the short code program will not be shared with any
        third parties for their marketing reasons/purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Service Providers: We work with third-party service providers to provide
        website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup,
        storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis,
        marketing, and other services for us, which may require them to access
        or use information about you. If a service provider needs to access
        information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so
        under close instruction from us, including appropriate security and
        confidentiality procedures designed to protect your information.
        <br />
        <br />
        CSM Partners: We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales,
        support, and technical services to deliver and implement customer
        solutions around the Services. We may disclose your information to these
        third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with
        billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide
        customizations. We may also disclose information to these third parties
        where you have agreed to that disclosure.
        <br />
        <br />
        Links to Third Party Sites: The Services may include links that direct
        you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ
        from ours. If you submit information to any of those third party sites,
        your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We
        encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you
        visit.
        <br />
        <br />
        Third Party Services: We may offer you the ability to interact with or
        disclose information to third parties through the Services. For example,
        we may offer users the ability to log in to the Services via a
        third-party service like Google, access embedded maps through Google
        Maps or interact with social media networks via links on the Services.
        When you intentionally interact with these third parties, we may
        disclose certain information to those third parties or receive
        information with those third parties, consistent with your privacy
        settings on the third-party service. Such information may include
        contact information, identification, and demographic information, and
        device information and identifiers. You should always check the privacy
        settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how
        those third-parties may use your information.
        <br />
        <br />
        With your consent: We disclose information about you to third parties
        when you give us consent to do so. For example, we often display
        personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites.
        With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.
        <br />
        <br />
        Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of
        Our Rights: In exceptional circumstances, we may disclose information
        about you to a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably
        necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal
        process or governmental request, including to meet national security
        requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service,
        (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d)
        protect CSM, our customers or the public from harm or illegal
        activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good
        faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the
        death or serious bodily injury of any person. For more information on
        how we respond to government requests, see our Guidelines for Law
        Enforcement and our Transparency Report.
        <br />
        <br />
        Disclosing to affiliated companies
        <br />
        <br />
        We disclose information we collect to affiliated companies and, in some
        cases, to prospective affiliates. Affiliated companies are companies
        owned or operated by us. The protections of this privacy policy apply to
        the information we disclose in these circumstances.
        <br />
        <br />
        CSM companies: We disclose information we have about you to other CSM
        corporate affiliates in order to operate and improve products and
        services and to offer other CSM affiliated services to you. This
        includes companies that own or operate the Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        Business Transfers: We may disclose or transfer information we collect
        under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company
        assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
        another company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent
        notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any
        choices you may have regarding your information.
        <br />
        <br />
        How we store and secure information we collect
        <br />
        <br />
        Information storage and security
        <br />
        <br />
        While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no
        security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the
        Internet, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission
        through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our
        care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you use our server or data center Services, responsibility for
        securing storage and access to the information you put into the Services
        rests with you and not CSM. We strongly recommend that server or data
        center users configure SSL to prevent interception of information
        transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and
        other storage points used.
        <br />
        <br />
        How long we keep information
        <br />
        <br />
        How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of
        information, as described in further detail below. After such time, we
        will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not
        possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup
        archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it
        from any further use until deletion is possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        Account information: We retain your account information for as long as
        your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you
        decide to re-activate the Services. aWe also retain some of your
        information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to
        resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business
        operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where
        we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take
        steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only
        use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our
        Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about
        you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Information you share on the Services: If your account is deactivated or
        disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided
        will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make
        full use of the Services. For example, we continue to display messages
        you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content
        you provided, but when requested details that can identify you will be
        removed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Marketing information: If you have elected to receive marketing emails
        from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a
        reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in
        our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased
        using your CSM account. We retain information derived from cookies and
        other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the
        date such information was created.
        <br />
        <br />
        How to access and control your information
        <br />
        <br />
        You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your
        information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them
        and any limitations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your Choices:
        <br />
        <br />
        Where applicable under local law, you may have certain rights with
        respect to your personal information.
        <br />
        <br />
        Depending on which jurisdiction you live in, you may have the right to
        request information about our processing of your information, to request
        a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information
        (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or
        restriction of your information, to request your information in a
        structured, electronic format, to request to correct or update your
        information, to request to opt out of “sales” or “sharing” of personal
        information and targeted advertising (as these terms are defined under
        applicable law), and to request to opt out of certain profiling
        activities. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these
        requests. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the
        Services and using settings available within the Services or your
        account.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example,
        if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another
        person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your
        administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate
        interests to keep. Where you have asked us to disclose data to third
        parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to
        contact those third-party service providers directly to have your
        information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved
        concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection
        authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you
        feel your rights were infringed. Where applicable under local law, you
        may also contact us as provided in the “Contact Us” section below to
        appeal any decision we make relating to your request to exercise your
        rights.
        <br />
        <br />
        Delete your information: Our Services and related documentation give you
        the ability to delete certain information about you from within the
        Service. For example, you can remove content that contains information
        about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with
        that content, and you can remove certain profile information within your
        profile settings. Please note, however, that we may need to retain
        certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete
        transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Request that we stop using your information: In some cases, you may ask
        us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your
        information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do
        so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you
        without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can
        request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where
        you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you
        can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any
        processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also
        opt-out of our use of your information for certain marketing purposes by
        contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may
        need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay
        or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your
        information, we will restrict any further use of your information until
        the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your
        administrator does not object (where applicable).
        <br />
        <br />
        Opt out of communications: You may opt out of receiving promotional
        communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email,
        updating your email preferences within your Service account settings
        menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact
        information removed from our promotional email list or registration
        database. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages
        from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us
        regarding our Services. You can opt out of some notification messages in
        your account settings. Please note, you will continue to receive generic
        ads.
        <br />
        <br />
        Turn off Cookie Controls: Relevant browser-based cookie controls are
        described in our Cookies & Tracking Notice.
        <br />
        <br />
        Send "Do Not Track" Signals: Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not
        Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit
        indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Our websites may not respond
        to all browser-based DNT signals; however, our websites do respond to
        the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) to opt-out of “sales” of personal
        information and targeted advertising in certain locales. For more
        information on the GPC and how to use a browser or browser extension
        incorporating the GPC signal, see https://globalprivacycontrol.org/. You
        can also use the range of other tools we provide to control data
        collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving
        marketing from us as described above.
        <br />
        <br />
        Data portability: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your
        information in a format you can move from one service provider to
        another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to
        another carrier). Depending on the context, this applies to some of your
        information, but not to all of your information. Should you request it,
        we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account
        information and the information you create on the spaces under your sole
        control, like your personal Bitbucket repository.
        <br />
        <br />
        How we transfer information we collect internationally
        <br />
        <br />
        International transfers of information we collect
        <br />
        <br />
        We collect information globally and may transfer, process, and store
        your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or
        our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing
        you the Services. Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps
        to protect it.
        <br />
        <br />
        International transfers within the CSM Companies: To facilitate our
        global operations, we transfer information globally and allow access to
        that information from countries in which the CSM owned or operated
        companies have operations for the purposes described in this policy.
        These countries may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws
        to the laws of many of the countries where our customers and users are
        based. When we disclose information about you within and among CSM
        corporate affiliates, we make use of the Data Privacy Framework to
        receive personal data transfers from the European Union/European
        Economic Area to the U.S. (see “Data Privacy Framework Notice” section
        below), and the standard contractual data protection clauses, which have
        been approved by the European Commission, to safeguard the transfer of
        information we collect from the European Economic Area, the United
        Kingdom (the "UK"), and Switzerland. Refer to this page for a list of
        countries to which we regularly transfer personal data.
        <br />
        <br />
        International transfers to third parties: Some of the third parties
        described in this privacy policy, which provide services to us under
        contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent
        privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside.
        When we disclose information of customers in the European Economic Area,
        the UK, or Switzerland, we make use of the European Commission-approved
        standard contractual data protection clauses, binding corporate rules
        for transfers to data processors, or other appropriate legal mechanisms
        to safeguard the transfer.
        <br />
        <br />
        Data Privacy Framework Notice
        <br />
        <br />
        On July 10, 2023, the European Commission’s adequacy decision for the
        EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF) entered into force.
        <br />
        <br />
        Call Sheet Media, LLC adheres to the Data Privacy Framework Principles
        regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data that is
        transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the U.S.
        <br />
        <br />
        CSM complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the
        UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy
        Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of
        Commerce. CSM has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it
        adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF
        Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from
        the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF
        and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. CSM has certified to the U.S.
        Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy
        Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the
        processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the
        Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this
        privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF
        Principles, the DPF Principles shall govern. To learn more about the
        Data Privacy Framework Program, please visit the Data Privacy Framework
        Program website here. To view CSM’s certifications, search for “CSM” in
        the Data Privacy Framework List.
        <br />
        <br />
        As required under the principles, when we receive information under the
        Data Privacy Framework and then transfer it to a third-party service
        provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability
        under the Data Privacy Framework if the agent processes the information
        in a manner inconsistent with the Data Privacy Framework and we are
        responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
        <br />
        <br />
        We encourage you to contact us as provided below should you have a Data
        Privacy Framework related (or general privacy-related) complaint. If you
        have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not
        addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party
        dispute resolution provider (free of charge). Through this third-party
        dispute resolution provider, we have also committed to cooperating and
        complying with the information and advice provided by an informal panel
        of data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, and/or the
        Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (as
        applicable) in relation to unresolved complaints (as further described
        in the Data Privacy Framework Principles). You may also contact your
        local data protection authority within the European Economic Area or
        Switzerland (as applicable) for unresolved complaints.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Data Privacy
        Framework website, including when other dispute resolution procedures
        have been exhausted, you may invoke binding arbitration.

        Retention: We retain your personal information for as long as necessary
        to carry out the business purposes described in this policy, or as
        otherwise required under law. The length of retention may vary depending
        upon factors such as recordkeeping or legal compliance requirements, the

        Exercising your rights: If you are a California resident, there are some
        additional rights that may be available to you under the California
        Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”). This policy explains the tools that we
        have made available to you to exercise your data rights under the CCPA,
        including such as the rights to request information about how we process
        your personal information, request deletion and the right to request
        access to the specific pieces of categories of personal information we
        have collected about you.
        <br />
        <br />
        For more information on how to exercise these your rights, please visit

        discriminated against for exercising any of your privacy rights under
        the CCPA. In order to protect your information from unauthorized access
        or deletion, we may require you to provide additional information to for

        Opt out of certain disclosures to third parties: You may also opt out of
        “sales” of personal information and “sharing” of personal information

        under 16 years of age.
        <br />
        <br />
        Authorized agent: You may also authorize an agent to exercise your
        rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide the authorized agent
        with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we
        may request a copy of this written permission from the agent when they
        make a request on your behalf. We may also ask you to verify your own
        identity and directly confirm with you that you have granted permission
        to the authorized agent.

        <br />
        The Services are not directed to individuals under 18. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we
