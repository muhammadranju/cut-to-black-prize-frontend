              Cut to Black Prize is intentionally small and highly selective. We
              invite a limited number of writers whose work signals craft,
              discipline, and a distinct voice. Every script is read blind by
              working producers and analysts, with the field kept tight so
              attention goes to depth, not volume. This is a competition
              designed for outcomes, not optics.
            </p>
            <p>
              The prize is singular because the promise is singular. One winner
              receives $10,000, a trip to Hollywood, and a scheduled meeting
              with a producer. If you were invited, you are part of a short list
              chosen for potential and readiness. This is the place to submit
              your strongest work.
